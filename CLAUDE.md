# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is currently an empty Machine Learning Projects directory. No existing codebase or configuration files were found.

## For Future Projects

When machine learning projects are added to this directory, update this file with:

1. **Project-specific commands**: Build, test, train, and deployment commands
2. **Dependencies and environment setup**: Python/conda environments, required packages
3. **Data pipeline**: Location of datasets, preprocessing scripts
4. **Model architecture**: Key model files and training scripts
5. **Evaluation metrics**: How to run evaluations and benchmarks

## Common ML Development Patterns

When working with ML projects in this directory, consider:
- Check for `requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`, or `pyproject.toml` for dependencies
- Look for Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) for exploratory analysis
- Identify training scripts (often `train.py` or similar)
- Locate configuration files for hyperparameters
